---Prometheus&Grafana---
Prometheus: Prometheus is a monitoring and alerting stack, it works on TSDB(timeseries database), Prometheus pulls the metrics
promQL: The dedicated querying language used by Prometheus to perform calculations
grafana: grafana provides the meaningfull data of prometheus to be visualisation
Service Discovery: With the help of Service discovery the services are identified which are need to scraped.
nodeExporter: it is use to collect the metrics of the system
Federation: Federation enables multiple Prometheus servers to work together in a hierarchical manner
Chunks: Chunks are compressed blocks of data that contain a range of samples for a specific time-series.
WAL (Write-Ahead Log): The WAL captures incoming samples before they are written to the main storage, providing a reliable mechanism to recover data in the event of a crash or restart.

------------kubernetes----------
kube-proxy: maintaining service rules for service to pod mapping, allowing communication to & from kubernetes cluster, kube-proxy acts as a L3 & L4 layer, loadbalancer
CNI: 

------------other---------------
TCP AND UDP: tcp and udp are used for transmission of data over the internet, while both belongs to transport layer of the osi model
1) TCP: tcp is a connection orinted protocall , it ensures the data packets are delivered in the correct order and with out error, it is slower data transmission
2) UDP: udp is a connection less protocall, it simply sends the data packets to the destination without verfiying, it is faster that tcp, commonly used for fast and low-latency connections like online gaming & video steming


--------------AWS---------------
ALB: 
Operates at Layer 7 (Application Layer) of the OSI model. It routes traffic based on application-level information
Supports advanced routing features like host-based and path-based routing
used Ideal for HTTP/HTTPS applications, web applications, microservices architectures
Supports HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket protocols
Can handle a high volume of application-layer traffic and supports autoscaling based on application demand, but typically has slightly higher latency due to Layer 7 processing.
Offers support for security features like AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) and user authentication via Amazon Cognito.
NLB:
Operates at Layer 4 (Transport Layer) of the OSI model. It routes traffic based on IP protocol data


-------------script-------------
shell: It is an interface between user and kernel.
