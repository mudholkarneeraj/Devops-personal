---Prometheus&Grafana---
Prometheus: Prometheus is a monitoring and alerting stack, it works on TSDB(timeseries database), Prometheus pulls the metrics
promQL: The dedicated querying language used by Prometheus to perform calculations
grafana: grafana provides the meaningfull data of prometheus to be visualisation
Service Discovery: With the help of Service discovery the services are identified which are need to scraped.
nodeExporter: it is use to collect the metrics of the system
Federation: Federation enables multiple Prometheus servers to work together in a hierarchical manner
Chunks: Chunks are compressed blocks of data that contain a range of samples for a specific time-series.
WAL (Write-Ahead Log): The WAL captures incoming samples before they are written to the main storage, providing a reliable mechanism to recover data in the event of a crash or restart.

------------kubernetes----------
kube-proxy: maintaining service rules for service to pod mapping, allowing communication to & from kubernetes cluster, kube-proxy acts as a L3 & L4 layer, loadbalancer
CNI: 

------------other---------------
TCP AND UDP: tcp and udp are used for transmission of data over the internet, while both belongs to transport layer of the osi model
1) TCP: tcp is a connection orinted protocall , it ensures the data packets are delivered in the correct order and with out error, it is slower data transmission
2) UDP: udp is a connection less protocall, it simply sends the data packets to the destination without verfiying, it is faster that tcp, commonly used for fast and low-latency connections like online gaming & video steming


--------------AWS---------------
ALB: 
Operates at Layer 7 (Application Layer) of the OSI model. It routes traffic based on application-level information
Supports advanced routing features like host-based and path-based routing
used Ideal for HTTP/HTTPS applications, web applications, microservices architectures
Supports HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket protocols
Can handle a high volume of application-layer traffic and supports autoscaling based on application demand, but typically has slightly higher latency due to Layer 7 processing.
Offers support for security features like AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) and user authentication via Amazon Cognito.
NLB:
Operates at Layer 4 (Transport Layer) of the OSI model. It routes traffic based on IP protocol data
Suitable for TCP/UDP applications, high-performance, low-latency applications
Supports static IPs and Elastic IPs, allowing each Availability Zone to have a static IP that doesn’t change, which is advantageous for whitelisting IPs or using fixed IPs.
Does not support WAF

• Example: if CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24, then reserved IP addresses are: 
        • 10.0.0.0 – Network Address
        • 10.0.0.1 – reserved by AWS for the VPC router
        • 10.0.0.2 – reserved by AWS for mapping to Amazon-provided DNS
        • 10.0.0.3 – reserved by AWS for future use
        • 10.0.0.255 – Network Broadcast Address.AWS does not support broadcast in aVPC, therefore the address is reserved
    
S3 Storage Classes: 
        • Amazon S3 Standard - General Purpose
        • Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (IA) 
        • Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
        • Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
        • Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive:
        • Amazon S3 Intelligent Tiering

-------------script-------------
shell: It is an interface between user and kernel.
