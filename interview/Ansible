Ansible:
———————————————————
Ansible is an open-source automation tool designed for configuration management, application deployment, task automation, and orchestration. It simplifies complex IT tasks, enabling users to define and manage infrastructure as code. Ansible uses a declarative language to describe the desired state of systems, and it works over SSH, eliminating the need for agent installation on managed nodes.
Ansible Playbooks:
* A playbook in Ansible is a YAML file containing a series of plays, where each play defines a set of tasks to be executed on a set of hosts.
* Plays consist of tasks, which are individual units of work, and each task maps to an Ansible module.
* Playbooks are written in YAML and are easy to read and write, making them human-readable and shareable.
* Playbooks can include variables, conditionals, and loops to make them flexible and dynamic.
* They are designed to orchestrate complex tasks and configurations on remote hosts.
Ansible Roles:
* An Ansible role is a way to organize and structure playbooks. It provides a means of dividing responsibilities and reusing code.
* Roles encapsulate functionality in a structured format, including tasks, variables, handlers, and templates.
* Roles have a predefined directory structure, making it easy to organize and share roles across projects.
* They can be used to define common patterns and configurations, promoting code reuse and maintainability.
* Roles can be included in playbooks, allowing for better organization and abstraction of complex configurations.
Example of an Ansible role directory structure: my_role/
├── tasks/
│   └── main.yml
├── handlers/
│   └── main.yml
├── defaults/
│   └── main.yml
├── templates/
│   └── my_template.j2
├── vars/
│   └── main.yml
└── meta/
    └── main.yml
==========================

$ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini my_playbook.yml --check
==> Ansible inventory file means /etc/hosts [webservers]
web1.example.com
web2.example.com

[databases]
db1.example.com
db2.example.com $ansible-playbook -i /path/to/dynamic_inventory_script my_playbook.yml
command Module:
* The command module is a simple and direct way to run a command on a remote host.
* It does not invoke a shell to execute the command. Instead, it runs the command directly.
* Because it doesn't use a shell, certain shell-specific features (e.g., pipes, redirects, wildcards, variables) are not interpreted, limiting its capabilities.
- name: Run a simple command
  command: echo "Hello” 
shell Module:
* The shell module, on the other hand, invokes a shell (such as /bin/sh or /bin/bash) to execute the command on the remote host.
* This allows the use of shell features, such as pipes, redirects, and variable interpolation, providing more flexibility.
- name: Run a command with shell features
  shell: echo "Hello, {{ variable }}"
Use the shell module when you need to use shell-specific syntax, variables, or complex command constructs.
