Hello, my name is Neeraj. I hold a B.Tech from Vasantrao Naik University, and my hometown is Mudhole. I have over 4.5 years of experience in DevOps and currently work as a Senior DevOps Engineer at Changejar. Prior to this, I worked with ClearTax and Xpedise.

Tools and Technologies
----------------------
Throughout my career, I’ve worked with a range of DevOps tools and technologies. I’ve built Kubernetes clusters from scratch, hosted and managed tools like Jenkins, Uptime Kuma, SonarQube, Nexus, and Ansible. I’ve also managed website hosting and AWS infrastructure creation.

Here are some of the tools I’ve used extensively:
Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Terraform, Helm
Containerization and Orchestration: Docker, Kubernetes
AWS Services: Creating VPCs, subnets, route tables, NAT gateways, and deploying various services
Monitoring and Logging: Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Node Exporter, Mimir, Elasticsearch, Kibana, Fluent Bit, Filebeat
Security and Configuration Management: Vault, Istio
I also worked on the SafeJar project, where I set up essential AWS infrastructure, including VPCs, subnets, route tables, NAT gateways, and services like Jenkins, Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Filebeat.
