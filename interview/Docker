* ==================================
DOCKER
====================================
* FROM specifies the base image for your Docker image. It is the starting point for building your image.
RUN:
* RUN is used to execute commands during the image build process. It is often used for installing software or performing other setup tasks.
MAINTAINER:
* MAINTAINER is used to specify the name and email address of the person maintaining the Dockerfile.
CMD:
* CMD sets the default command to be executed when a container is run from the image. It can be overridden when starting a container.
ENTRYPOINT:
* ENTRYPOINT sets the primary command that will be run when the container starts. It is often used to define the main application process.
ADD:
* ADD is a more powerful instruction that not only copies files but also has additional features. It can also fetch files from remote URLs and extract tar archives.
* While ADD can be more versatile, it is often advised to use COPY for simple file copying to maintain clarity and avoid unexpected behavior.
COPY:
* COPY is a straightforward and simple instruction used to copy files or directories from the build context into the image.
