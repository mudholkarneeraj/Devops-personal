—————————— S3 Bucket Types:
* Standard Storage:
    * The default storage class for S3.
    * Designed for frequently accessed data with low latency and high throughput.
    * Provides high durability and availability.
* Intelligent-Tiering:
    * Automatically moves objects between two access tiers (frequent and infrequent access) based on changing access patterns.
    * Optimizes costs for data with unknown or changing access patterns.
* One Zone-Infrequent Access (Z-IA):
    * Stores data in a single availability zone.
    * Offers cost savings compared to standard storage, but with lower durability (99.5%).
* 		Glacier Storage Classes:
    * Designed for archiving and long-term storage with low retrieval frequency.
    * Data is stored in Glacier, a low-cost storage service with longer retrieval times. Glacier (S3 Glacier):
        * For data archiving with retrieval times ranging from minutes to hours.
        * Suitable for scenarios where data retrieval speed is less critical.
    * Glacier Deep Archive (S3 Glacier Deep Archive):
        * For long-term data archiving with retrieval times ranging from 12 to 48 hours.
        * Lowest-cost storage option but with the longest retrieval times.
* 		Reduced Redundancy Storage (deprecated):
    * Originally designed for non-critical, reproducible data.
    * Deprecated, and users are encouraged to use the Standard storage class or Intelligent-Tiering instead.
==> EC2 enables users to run virtual servers, known as instances, on-demand

----------------------------vpc-peering-------------------------------
vpc1-->subnet1-->internetgateway-->routetable-->associate subnet and internetgateway-->ec2-instance1
vpc2-->subnet2-->internetgateway-->routetable-->associate subnet and internetgateway-->ec2-instance2
vpc-pering
configure vpc1 and vp2 --> edit routetable and give cidr range, it should connect to vpc-peering
---------------------------vpc-transist-gateway-----------------------
with the help of transit gateway, we can connect multiple VPC's
