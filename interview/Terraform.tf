$ terraform plan vs terraform apply:
terraform plan shows proposed changes without applying them, helping to review what will change in the infrastructure.
terraform apply executes those changes, creating or updating resources.

$ Purpose of a Terraform provider:
Providers allow Terraform to interact with cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, GCP) by translating Terraform configurations into API calls. Common providers include AWS, Azure, and Kubernetes.

$terraform import brings existing resources into the state without creating new ones, useful when integrating with resources not originally managed by Terraform.

$ Managing sensitive information in the state file:
Sensitive information should be managed using secure backends like AWS S3 with encryption, avoiding plaintext storage and using tools like HashiCorp Vault for secrets.

$ Remote backends like S3 with DynamoDB for locking prevent conflicts and ensure consistent state. Collaborators canâ€™t modify the state simultaneously, preventing overwrite conflicts.

$terraform taint:
Marks a resource for destruction and recreation on the next apply, useful for correcting corrupted or malfunctioning resources without altering other infrastructure.

$ Using tools like terraform validate and terraform plan for syntax and dependency checks, and Terratest or similar frameworks for integration testing before production deployment.

$ Managing S3 buckets with Terraform:
Configure aws_s3_bucket with versioning and lifecycle rules to manage data retention and costs. aws_s3_bucket_policy allows fine-grained access control.
