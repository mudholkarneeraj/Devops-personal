Prometheus:
=======================
Data Model:
* Prometheus uses a multi-dimensional data model with time-series data identified by metric names and key-value pairs.
* Each time-series consists of a metric name, a set of key-value pairs (labels), and the actual time-series data points.
Query Language (PromQL):
* PromQL is a powerful query language used to retrieve and process data from Prometheus.
Alerting Rules:
* Prometheus includes a built-in alerting system with alerting rules defined in its configuration.
Federation:
* Federation enables multiple Prometheus servers to work together in a hierarchical manner, allowing for scalable and distributed monitoring.
Exporters:
* Prometheus exporters are small applications that expose metrics in a format Prometheus can understand. They are used to monitor services or components that do not natively expose Prometheus metrics.
Chunks:
* To optimize storage and query performance, Prometheus organizes samples into chunks.
* Chunks are compressed blocks of data that contain a range of samples for a specific time-series.
* Prometheus uses a technique called chunk encoding to efficiently store and retrieve chunks of time-series data.
WAL (Write-Ahead Log):
* Prometheus uses a Write-Ahead Log (WAL) to ensure data durability and recoverability in case of failures.
* The WAL captures incoming samples before they are written to the main storage, providing a reliable mechanism to recover data in the event of a crash or restart.
In summary, Prometheus organizes time-series data using a multi-dimensional data model, where each time-series is uniquely identified by its metric name and a set of labels. The data is stored as samples in chunks, and the retention period, along with the WAL, ensures efficient storage, querying, and durability of historical data.
Remote Storage Solutions:
    * Utilize remote storage solutions that are designed for long-term data retention. Popular choices include:
    * Thanos: Thanos is an open-source project that extends Prometheus with long-term storage capabilities. It allows you to store and query Prometheus data across multiple Prometheus instances and provides features like downsampling and deduplication.
    * Cortex: Cortex is another open-source project that extends Prometheus for scalability and long-term storage. It is horizontally scalable and supports remote storage backends like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage.â€¨
