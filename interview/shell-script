  echo  “even number”
else 
  echo “odd number”
fi
----------------------------
-Write an example of OR operator.
#! /bin/bash
Echo –n “enter any number : “
read n
if  [[ ( $n –eq 10 || $n  -eq 45) ]]
then 
  echo “ you win”
else  
  echo “ you lost!”
fi
---------------------------
-Write a script for adding multiple values.
#! /bin/bash
Sum=0
For (( counter=1 ; counter<5 ;counter++))
Do
  Echo –n “enter your number”
read n
(( sum+=n))
#echo –n “$counter”
Done 
Printf   “\n”
echo  “result is : $ sum”
-----------------------------------------
-Write an example of a function.
#! /bin/bash 
Function Add()
{
echo  –n “enter number:”
read a
echo  –n  “enter 2nd number :”
read b
echo “addition  is: $((  a+b ))”
}

—What is a shell? 
A shell is a command-line interpreter between either a user or an application and the operating system’s kernel. The kernel manages and controls access to the computer’s resources and hardware. The shell is a layer on top of the kernel that communicates with the kernel to send commands to the hardware. 
—What is a shell script? 
A shell script is simply a series of shell commands in a plain text file executed sequentially to accomplish a task.

You can use test or [ ] to evaluate conditions. The conditions can be related to numbers, strings, or file types.

Numeric Comparisons:

-eq: equal to
-ne: not equal to
-lt: less than
-le: less than or equal to
-gt: greater than
-ge: greater than or equal to
String Comparisons:

=: equal to
!=: not equal to
-z: string is null (has zero length)
-n: string is not null (has non-zero length)
File Conditions:

-e: file exists
-r: file is readable
-w: file is writable
-x: file is executable
-d: directory exists
-f: file exists and is a regular file
-s: file is not empty
