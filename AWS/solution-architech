1. You can only have 5 Elastic IP in your account
2. When we are doing SSH into our EC2 machines:
    • We can’t use a private IP, because we are not in the same network • We can only use the public IP.
3. If your machine is stopped and then started, the public IP can change
4. 10 Gbps bandwidth with in the zone 
5. Cons: If the AZ fails, all instances fails at the same time
6.   You can create ENI independently and attach them on the fly (move them) on EC2 instances for failover
7. An instance can NOT be hibernated more than 60 days
    Hibernate: • Supported Instance Families – C3, C4, C5, I3, M3, M4, R3, R4,T2,T3, ...
                • Instance RAM Size – must be less than 150 GB.
                • Instance Size – not supported for bare metal instances.
                • AMI – Amazon Linux 2, Linux AMI, Ubuntu, RHEL, CentOS & Windows... • Root Volume – must be EBS, encrypted, not instance store, and large
                • Available for On-Demand, Reser ved and Spot Instances
8. • It’s locked to an Availability Zone (AZ)
    • An EBS Volume in us-east-1a cannot be attached to us-east-1b 
    • To move a volume across, you first need to snapshot it
9. EBS Snapshots Features: 
    • EBS Snapshot Archive: • Move a Snapshot to an ”archive tier” that is 75% cheaper
                            • Takes within 24 to 72 hours for restoring the archive
    • Recycle Bin for EBS Snapshots: • Setup rules to retain deleted snapshots so you can recover them after an accidental deletion
                                      • Specify retention (from 1 day to 1 year)
10. • EBS Volumes are characterized in Size | Throughput | IOPS (I/O Ops Per Sec), • Only gp2/gp3 and io1/io2 Block Express can be used as boot volumes
     - EBS Multi-Attach – io1/io2 family
11. EFS(Elastic File System): • EFS works with EC2 instances in multi-AZ, Highly available, scalable, expensive (3x gp2), pay per use 
12. EBS vs EFS – Elastic Block Storage:   • EBS volumes...
                                              • one instance (except multi-attach io1/io2)
                                              • are locked at the Availability Zone (AZ) level • gp2: IO increases if the disk size increases
                                              • gp3 & io1: can increase IO independently
                                          • To migrate an EBS volume across AZ 
                                              • Take a snapshot
                                              • Restore the snapshot to another AZ
                                              • EBS backups use IO and you shouldn’t run them while your application is handling a lot of traffic
13. Types of load balancer on AWS: 
    • Classic Load Balancer: Suppor ts TCP (Layer 4), HTTP & HTTPS (Layer 7)
    • Application Load Balancer: Application load balancers is Layer 7 (HTTP), Suppor t for HTTP/2 and WebSocket,• ALB are a great fit for micro services & container-based application
                                • The application servers don’t see the IP of the client directly
                                    • The true IP of the client is inserted in the header X-Forwarded-For
                                    • We can also get Port (X-Forwarded-Port) and proto (X-Forwarded-Proto)
                                     No charges for inter AZ data
    • Network Load Balancer (Layer 4): Forward TCP & UDP traffic to your instances,Handle millions of request per seconds, Less latency ~100 ms (vs 400 ms for ALB)
                                      NLB has one static IP per AZ, and supports assigning Elastic IP(helpful for whitelisting specific IP), You pay charges ($) for inter AZ data if enabled
    • Gateway Load Balancer(Layer 3 (Network Layer)): Deploy, scale, and manage a fleet of 3rd party network virtual appliances in AWS, Example: Firewalls, Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems, Deep Packet Inspection Systems, payload manipulation, ...
    • Some load balancers can be setup as internal (private) or external (public) ELBs
14. Sticky Sessions (Session Affinity): It is possible to implement stickiness so that the same client is always redirected to the same instance behind a load balancer
                                        For both CLB & ALB, the “cookie” used for stickiness has an expiration date you control
15. ElastiCache: Applications queries ElastiCache, if not available, get from RDS and store in ElastiCache, Helps relieve load in RDS
16. Redis vs Memcached:
    REDIS
        • Multi AZ with Auto-Failover
        • Read Replicas to scale reads and have high availability

            .com
            example.com
            www.example.com
            api.example.com
    • TTL – amount of time the record cached at DNS Resolvers
    • Route 53 supports the following DNS record types:
        • (must know)A /AAAA / CNAME / NS
        • (advanced)CAA/DS/MX/NAPTR/PTR/SOA/TXT/SPF/SRV
    • A – maps a hostname to IPv4
    • AAAA – maps a hostname to IPv6
    • CNAME – maps a hostname to another hostname
    • The target is a domain name which must have an A or AAAA record
    • Can’t create a CNAME record for the top node of a DNS namespace (Zone Apex)
    • Example: you can’t create for example.com, but you can create for www.example.com
    • NS – Name Servers for the Hosted Zone
    • Control how traffic is routed for a domain
18. Elastic Beanstalk: Elastic Beanstalk is a developer centric view of deploying an application on AWS, • It uses all the component’s we’ve seen before: EC2, ASG, ELB, RDS, ...

            • Any HTTP backend you want
29. CloudFront Geo Restriction: • You can restrict who can access your distribution
30. CloudFront – Cache Invalidations: In case you update the back-end origin, CloudFront doesn’t know about it and will only get the refreshed content after the TTL has expired, You can invalidate all files (*) or a special path (/images/*)
31: Unicast IP vs Anycast IP: 
        • Unicast IP: one server holds one IP address
        • Anycast IP: all servers hold the same IP address and the client is routed to the nearest one
32. AWS Global Accelerator vs CloudFront:
        • CloudFront
            • Improves performance for both cacheable content (such as images and videos)

            • Default retention of messages: 4 days, maximum of 14 days • Low latency (<10 ms on publish and receive)
            • Limitation of 256KB per message sent
        SQS: By default, the “message visibility timeout” is 30 seconds, • That means the message has 30 seconds to be processed
            • After the message visibility timeout is over, the message is “visible” in SQS
            • If a message is not processed within the visibility timeout, it will be processed twice 
            • A consumer could call the ChangeMessageVisibility API to get more time
            • If visibility timeout is high (hours), and consumer crashes, re-processing will take time 
            • If visibility timeout is too low (seconds), we may get duplicates
        Long Polling: When a consumer requests messages from the queue, it can optionally “wait” for messages to arrive if there are none in the queue
        FIFO Queue: • Limited throughput: 300 msg/s without batching, 3000 msg/s with
39. Amazon SNS – How to publish

        • Get timeline of changes and compliance
81.Why encryption?
    Server-side encryption at rest
    • Data is encrypted after being received by the server
    • Data is decrypted before being sent
    • It is stored in an encrypted form thanks to a key (usually a data key)
    • The encryption / decryption keys must be managed somewhere, and the server must have access to it
82. Server-side encryption at rest
    • Data is encrypted after being received by the server
    • Data is decrypted before being sent
    • It is stored in an encrypted form thanks to a key (usually a data key)
    • The encryption / decryption keys must be managed somewhere, and the server must have access to it
83. Client-side encryption
    • Data is encrypted by the client and never decrypted by the server • Data will be decrypted by a receiving client
    • The server should not be able to decrypt the data
    • Could leverage Envelope Encryption
84. AWS KMS
• Anytime you hear “encryption” for an AWS service, it’s most likely KMS
    KMS KeysTypes
        • Symmetric (AES-256 keys)
            • Single encryption key that is used to Encrypt and Decrypt
            • AWS services that are integrated with KMS use Symmetric CMKs
            • You never get access to the KMS Key unencrypted (must call KMS API to use)
        • Asymmetric (RSA & ECC key pairs)
            • Public (Encrypt) and Private Key (Decrypt) pair
            • Used for Encrypt/Decrypt, or Sign/Verify operations
            • The public key is downloadable, but you can’t access the Private Key unencrypted
            • Use case: encryption outside of AWS by users who can’t call the KMS API
85. AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)
        • Easily provision, manage, and deploy TLS Cer tificates • Provide in-flight encryption for websites (HTTPS)
        • Supports both public and privateTLS certificates
        • Free of charge for publicTLS certificates
        • AutomaticTLS certificate renewal
        • Integrations with (loadTLS certificates on) • ElasticLoadBalancers(CLB,ALB,NLB)
        • CloudFront Distributions • APIs on API Gateway
        • Cannot use ACM with EC2 (can’t be extracted)
86.ACM – Requesting Public Certificates
    List domain names to be included in the certificate • Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN): corp.example.com • WildcardDomain:*.example.com
    Select Validation Method: DNS Validation or Email validation
    • DNS Validation is preferred for automation purposes
    • Email validation will send emails to contact addresses in the WHOIS database • DNS Validation will leverage a CNAME record to DNS config (ex: Route 53)
    It will take a few hours to get verified
    The Public Certificate will be enrolled for automatic renewal
    • ACM automatically renews ACM-generated certificates 60 days before expiry
87. API Gateway - Endpoint Types
    • Edge-Optimized (default): For global clients
    • Requests are routed through the CloudFront Edge locations (improves latency) • The API Gateway still lives in only one region
    • Regional:
    • For clients within the same region
    • Could manually combine with CloudFront (more control over the caching strategies and the distribution)
    • Private:
    • Can only be accessed from your VPC using an interface VPC endpoint (ENI)
    • Use a resource policy to define access
88.AWS WAF – Web Application Firewall
    • Protects your web applications from common web exploits (Layer 7)
    • Layer 7 is HTTP (vs Layer 4 is TCP/UDP)
    • Deploy on
        • Application Load Balancer
        • API Gateway
        • CloudFront
        • AppSync GraphQL API
        • Cognito User Pool
    • Define Web ACL (Web Access Control List) Rules:
        • IP Set: up to 10,000 IP addresses – use multiple Rules for more IPs
        • HTTP headers, HTTP body, or URI strings Protects from common attack - SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
        • Size constraints, geo-match (block countries)
        • Rate-based rules (to count occurrences of events) – for DDoS protection
        • Web ACL are Regional except for CloudFront
        • A rule group is a reusable set of rules that you can add to a web ACL
        • WAF does not support the Network Load Balancer (Layer 4)
        • We can use Global Accelerator for fixed IP and WAF on the ALB
89. AWS Shield: protect from DDoS attack
    • DDoS: Distributed Denial of Service – many requests at the same time • AWS Shield Standard:
    • Free service that is activated for every AWS customer
    • Provides protection from attacks such as SYN/UDP Floods, Reflection attacks and other
    • AWS Shield Advanced:
    • Optional DDoS mitigation service ($3,000 per month per organization)
    • Protect against more sophisticated attack on Amazon EC2, Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), Amazon CloudFront, AWS Global Accelerator, and Route 53
    • 24/7 access to AWS DDoS response team (DRP)
    • Protect against higher fees during usage spikes due to DDoS
    • Shield Advanced automatic application layer DDoS mitigation automatically creates, evaluates and deploys AWS WAF rules to mitigate layer 7 attacks
90. AWS Firewall Manager
    • Manage rules in all accounts of an AWS Organization
    • Rules are applied to new resources as they are created (good for compliance) across all and future accounts in your Organization
91. WAF vs. Firewall Manager vs. Shield
    • WAF, Shield and Firewall Manager are used together for comprehensive protection
    • Define your Web ACL rules in WAF
    • For granular protection of your resources,WAF alone is the correct choice
    • If you want to use AWS WAF across accounts, accelerate WAF configuration, automate the protection of new resources, use Firewall Manager with AWS WAF
    • Shield Advanced adds additional features on top of AWS WAF, such as dedicated suppor t from the Shield ResponseTeam (SRT) and advanced reporting.
    • If you’re prone to frequent DDoS attacks, consider purchasing Shield Advanced
92. Amazon Inspector evaluate
    • Package vulnerabilities (EC2, ECR & Lambda) – database of CVE
    • Network reachability (EC2)
    • Remember : only for EC2 instances, Container Images & Lambda functions
93. Understanding CIDR – IPv4 • A CIDR consists of two components
    • Base IP
        • Represents an IP contained in the range (XX.XX.XX.XX) • Example:10.0.0.0,192.168.0.0,...
    • Subnet Mask
        • Defines how many bits can change in the IP
        • Example:/0,/24,/32
        • Can take two forms: • /8ó255.0.0.0
        • /16ó255.255.0.0
        • /24ó255.255.255.0
        • /32ó255.255.255.255
94. Public vs. Private IP (IPv4)
        • The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) established certain blocks of IPv4 addresses for the use of private (LAN) and public (Internet) addresses
        • Private IP can only allow certain values:
        • 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255 (10.0.0.0/8)çin big networks
        • 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255 (172.16.0.0/12)çAWS defaultVPC in that range • 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255 (192.168.0.0/16) ç e.g., home networks
        • All the rest of the IP addresses on the Internet are Public
95. VPC in AWS – IPv4
        • VPC =Virtual Private Cloud
        • You can have multiple VPCs in an AWS region (max. 5 per region – soft limit)
        • Max. CIDR per VPC is 5, for each CIDR: • Min. size is /28 (16 IP addresses)
        • Max. size is /16 (65536 IP addresses)
        • Because VPC is private, only the Private IPv4 ranges are allowed: • 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255 (10.0.0.0/8)
        • 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255 (172.16.0.0/12)
        • 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255 (192.168.0.0/16)
        • Your VPC CIDR should NOT overlap with your other networks (e.g., corporate)
96. VPC – Subnet (IPv4)
    • AWS reserves 5 IP addresses (first 4 & last 1) in each subnet
    • These 5 IP addresses are not available for use and can’t be assigned to an EC2 instance
    • Example: if CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24, then reserved IP addresses are: • 10.0.0.0 – Network Address
        • 10.0.0.1 – reserved by AWS for the VPC router
        • 10.0.0.2 – reserved by AWS for mapping to Amazon-provided DNS
        • 10.0.0.3 – reserved by AWS for future use
        • 10.0.0.255 – Network Broadcast Address.AWS does not support broadcast in aVPC, therefore the address is reserved
    • Exam Tip, if you need 29 IP addresses for EC2 instances:
        • You can’t choose a subnet of size /27 (32 IP addresses, 32 – 5 = 27 < 29)
        • You need to choose a subnet of size /26 (64 IP addresses, 64 – 5 = 59 > 29)
97. Internet Gateway (IGW)
    • Allows resources (e.g., EC2 instances) in a VPC connect to the Internet • It scales horizontally and is highly available and redundant
    • Must be created separately from a VPC
    • OneVPC can only be attached to one IGW and vice versa
    • Internet Gateways on their own do not allow Internet access... • Route tables must also be edited!
98. Bastion Hosts
    • We can use a Bastion Host to SSH into our private EC2 instances
    • The bastion is in the public subnet which is then connected to all other private subnets
    • Bastion Host security group must allow inbound from the internet on port 22 from restricted CIDR, for example the public CIDR of your corporation
99. NAT Instance (outdated, but still at the exam)
        • NAT = Network Address Translation
        • Allows EC2 instances in private subnets to
    connect to the Internet
        • Must be launched in a public subnet
        • Must disable EC2 setting: Source / destination Check
        • Must have Elastic IP attached to it
        • RouteTables must be configured to route traffic from private subnets to the NAT Instance
100. NAT Gateway
        • AWS-managed NAT, higher bandwidth, high availability, no administration
        • Pay per hour for usage and bandwidth
        • NATGW is created in a specific Availability Zone, uses an Elastic IP
        • Can’t be used by EC2 instance in the same subnet (only from other subnets)
        • Requires an IGW (Private Subnet => NATGW => IGW)
        • 5 Gbps of bandwidth with automatic scaling up to 100 Gbps
        • No Security Groups to manage / required
101. Network Access Control List (NACL)
        • NACL are like a firewall which control traffic from and to subnets
        • One NACL per subnet, new subnets are assigned the Default NACL
        • You define NACL Rules:
        • Rules have a number (1-32766), higher precedence with a lower number
        • First rule match will drive the decision
        • Example: if you define #100 ALLOW 10.0.0.10/32 and #200 DENY 10.0.0.10/32, the IP address will be allowed because 100 has a higher precedence over 200
        • The last rule is an asterisk (*) and denies a request in case of no rule match
        • AWS recommends adding rules by increment of 100
        • Newly created NACLs will deny everything
        • NACL are a great way of blocking a specific IP address at the subnet level
102. VPC Peering
        • Privately connect two VPCs using AWS’ network
        • Make them behave as if they were in the same network
        • Must not have overlapping CIDRs
        • VPC Peering connection is NOT transitive (must be established for each VPC that need to communicate with one another)
        • You must update route tables in each VPC’s subnets to ensure EC2 instances can communicate with each other
        • You can create VPC Peering connection between VPCs in different AWS accounts/regions
        • You can reference a security group in a peeredVPC (works cross accounts – same region)
103. VPC Endpoints (AWS PrivateLink)
    • Every AWS service is publicly exposed (public URL)
    • VPC Endpoints (powered by AWS PrivateLink) allows you to connect to AWS services using a private network instead of using the public Internet
    • They’re redundant and scale horizontally
    • They remove the need of IGW, NATGW, ...to access AWS Services
    • In case of issues:
    • Check DNS Setting Resolution in your VPC • CheckRouteTables
    Types of Endpoints
        • Interface Endpoints (powered by PrivateLink)
        • Provisions an ENI (private IP address) as an entry point (must attach a Security Group)
        • Supports most AWS services
        • $ per hour + $ per GB of data processed
        • Gateway Endpoints
        • Provisions a gateway and must be used as a target in a route table (does not use security groups)
        • Supports both S3 and DynamoDB
        • Free
104: Direct Connect Gateway
    • If you want to setup a Direct Connect to one or more VPC in many different regions (same account), you must use a Direct Connect Gateway
105. Transit Gateway
        • For having transitive peering between thousands of VPC and on-premises, hub-and-spoke (star) connection
        • Regional resource, can work cross-region
        • Share cross-account using Resource Access Manager (RAM)
        • You can peer Transit Gateways across regions
        • RouteTables:limitwhichVPCcantalkwithotherVPC
        • Works with Direct Connect Gateway,VPN connections
        • Supports IP Multicast (not supported by any other AWS ser vice)
